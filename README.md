# Multiple Activities and Intents Example Project

## Introduction
___

In this project we see how the connection between multiple activities and the transfer of data between them can be achieved. In order to achieve the above objective, a small application was created which, after the user's entry, presents some regions of Greece that lead us each one to some peri-regional units and from there to a city of the region. In the final stage, we can use two buttons to either go to the city's website or to the map.

## Design and develop from scratch
___

In this application we will see: 
* how to transfer data from one activity to another
* how to receive data in an activity
* how to send data back to the first activity
* how we can handle configuration changes, through AndroidManifest

The registration form is only intended to show how the edited data will remain after a configuration change.
